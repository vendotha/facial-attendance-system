# Facial Attendance System

Welcome to the **Facial Attendance System** repository! This project is a modern, interactive, and efficient attendance management system built using **Django**, **OpenCV**, and **SQLite**. It leverages facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking, making it ideal for classrooms, offices, or any environment where attendance needs to be recorded.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and face recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- **Django Backend**: A robust and scalable web framework to manage users, attendance records, and system settings.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight and efficient database to store user profiles, attendance logs, and system data.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Modern and user-friendly dashboard with statistical charts for attendance analysis.
- **Real-Time Attendance Tracking**: Mark attendance in real-time using a webcam.
- **Export Attendance**: Export attendance records to CSV or Excel for further analysis.
